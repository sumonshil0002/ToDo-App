ðŸš€ To-Do List App

Iâ€™m excited to showcase my To-Do List App, developed using MVVM Architecture and modern Android development practices. While the core features are fully functional, some exciting enhancements are still under construction!

Key Features:
Room Database Integration: Persistent local storage for tasks.
Task Reminders with Alarm Manager: Schedule tasks and receive notifications.
Dark and Light Mode Compatibility: User-friendly design with Material 3 Themes.
Built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a clean MVVM architecture for scalability and maintainability.
Upcoming Enhancements:
Advanced task filtering and sorting options.
Cloud sync for cross-device task management.
Enhanced notification interactions.
This project demonstrates my understanding of ViewModel, LiveData, and the Repository Pattern. Feel free to explore the GitHub repository, share feedback, or contribute to the projectâ€™s growth!
